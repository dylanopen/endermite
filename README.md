# Endermite: the utility plugin for semi-vanilla servers

Endermite is the custom plugin for
[the Vanillacraft SMP](https://vanillacraft.org).


Feel free to use this plugin however you wish, and don't forget

- `/createwarp <warpName>` - creates a warp at the current location with the given name
- `/setwarp <warpName>` - same as `createwarp`
